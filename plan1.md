🎰 Craps Tracker App (Flutter + Dart) - Project Plan & Implementation Details
Below is a thoughtfully detailed and strategic plan to guide the development of an award-winning Craps Tracker App.
The app’s primary purpose is to track detailed dice roll statistics in a craps game, organized by numbers rolled in total, rolls by each individual player, and incorporate predictive analytics to provide users with a potential edge while playing craps.

📱 1. Overview & Goals:
Primary Goals:
Allow easy input and tracking of dice rolls.
Maintain detailed individual player statistics and overall roll statistics.
Incorporate mathematical predictive analytics to indicate the probability of specific numbers appearing.
Visualize data clearly to help users leverage insights during gameplay.
Target Users:
Casual and semi-professional craps players seeking to track rolls in real-time.
Statistically-inclined individuals who want an evidence-based advantage in the game.
Core Technologies:
Flutter (UI, Cross-platform) ✅
Dart (Programming) ✅
Local Database (Storage) ✅ (SQLite or Hive)
Statistical Methodologies (Predictions) ✅
🎲 2. App Functionality:
📍 Key Features:
Dice Tracking: Track dice rolls quickly and conveniently.
Player Management: Add/remove players, provide detailed stats per player.
Historical Data: Log past dice rolls to help analyze patterns.
Data Visualization: Provide statistical visualizations using charts and graphs.
Predictive Analytics: Real-time statistics and probability percentage-based analysis of next possible dice rolls.
Settings and preferences: Customization regarding app themes, notifications, and general settings.
🛠️ 3. App Structure & Components:
📐 Application Architecture:
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
BloC or Provider for State Management
Database integration (Hive or SQLite via sqflite)

⚙️ 4. Database Schema (SQLite/Hive):
🎲 Roll Table
Column	Type	Description
roll_id	Int	Unique ID (Primary key)
player_id	Int	ID linking to the player
dice_one	Int	Result of first dice (values 1-6)
dice_two	Int	Result of second dice (values 1-6)
roll_total	Int	Total sum (2-12)
timestamp	DateTime	Time roll was made
🧍 Player Table
Column	Type	Description
player_id	Int	Unique ID (Primary key)
player_name	String	Name of player
created_at	DateTime	Player creation date/time
📊 5. Predictive Analytics (Statistical Component):
Calculate probabilities based on established dice probability models.
Aggregate previous roll statistics to identify emerging patterns.
Implement predictive algorithms (simple probability and historical frequency analysis).
🎯 Sample Probability Calculation Methods:

class ProbabilityCalculator {
  // Static probabilities for dice total (2 dice)
  static final Map<int, double> diceRollProbability = {
    2: 1/36,
    3: 2/36,
    4: 3/36,
    5: 4/36,
    6: 5/36,
    7: 6/36,
    8: 5/36,
    9: 4/36,
    10: 3/36,
    11: 2/36,
    12: 1/36
  };

  double probabilityOfNextRoll(int targetNum, List<int> historicalRolls) {
    // Combine probability with historical frequency
    double basicProb = diceRollProbability[targetNum] ?? 0;
    double historicalFreq = historicalRolls.where((element) => element == targetNum).length / historicalRolls.length;

    // Simple heuristic combining basic dice probablility with historical frequency
    return (basicProb + historicalFreq) / 2;
  }
}
Use combination of basic and historical statistics to present a weighted probability to players.

📈 6. Data Visualization:
Implement using fl_chart (barChart, lineChart) or charts_flutter (reliable, provided by Google).
Graphical analysis of past rolls (Totals and per Player).
Graph or visuals for predictive probability of future outcomes.
🎨 7. UX/UI Considerations:
Clean, modern, intuitive design.
Quick access buttons for real-time input of dice values.
Customized themes (dark mode, casino themes).
UI Elements:

Dice visuals to represent inputs.
Easy navigation (bottom nav or floating action buttons for primary actions).
Clear visual display of probabilities and stats.
🧪 8. Testing:
Unit Tests for each method (flutter_test).
Integration Tests for screen interactions.
User-acceptance test scenarios (manual).
📅 9. Implementation Phases:
Phase 1:
Setup Flutter project, UI scaffolding.
Database integration, basic dice rolling and storing rolls.
Phase 2:
Player management.
Historical logging and data storage/retrieval.
Phase 3:
Predictive analytics engine.
Probability calculation and visual representations.
Phase 4:
Advanced visualization and charts.
User feedback refinements.
✅ 10. Deployment
Android (Play Store).
iOS (App Store).
Continuous Deployment (CD) can be set up via Bitrise, Codemagic, GitHub Actions.

🚀 Summary & Final Thoughts:
This Craps Tracker App, developed with Flutter + Dart, will empower users with actionable insights into dice-rolling patterns, helping them make informed decisions with higher confidence and probability-based strategy.
