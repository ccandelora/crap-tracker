Step 1: Initial Project Setup & Offline Support
Essential Tasks:
Flutter and Dart setup
Set up Flutter project structure with clean architecture.
Organize files into logical units: controllers, models, views, services.
Offline Capability
Implement local storage:
Recommended package: hive or isar.
Store player data, sessions, roll history, and statistics locally.
Data persistence and caching:
Save user sessions, rolling history, and statistics in local databases to ensure smooth offline operations.
Step 2: Data Models and Database Design
Essential Tasks:
Define clear and structured data models, including:

Player
ID (String or UUID)
Name (String)
Total Rolls (int)
Total Sessions (int)
Avg. Rolls per Session (double)
DiceRoll
ID (String or UUID)
Player ID (String)
Roll Value (int)
Timestamp (DateTime)
Session (Seven-Out Session)
ID (String or UUID)
Player ID (String)
Start timestamp (DateTime)
End timestamp (DateTime)
Total rolls in this session (int)
Duration of session (int seconds or milliseconds)
Step 3: Application State & Logic
Essential Tasks:
Use Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC patterns for state management.
Ensure efficient data flow updates across UI components when player rolls dice or sessions start and stop.
Logic Implementation:
Session Management Logic:

Automatically start a new session timer when the player rolls for the first time.
Stop (seven-out) whenever the roll condition for "seven-out" occurs (e.g., rolling a 7).
Record each session's duration and roll count.
Roll Tracking Logic:

Increment player's roll count every time dice are rolled.
Update session roll count every roll.
Step 4: User Interface Updates
UI Components to Implement:
Player Tracking Screen:
Display player's statistics (rolls total, session averages).
Dice Rolling Interface:
Display dice results clearly.
Display current session statistics (current session duration, roll count, etc.).
Historical Session Log Screen:
List previous sessions, time spent, and roll counts clearly.
Step 5: Analytics and Statistics
Tasks:
Provide insightful statistics:
Total rolls per player (per session and lifetime).
Session duration averages, longest session, shortest session, etc.
Visual representations:
Graphs/charts to visualize session lengths and roll distributions.
Step 6: Testing & Validation
Essential Tasks:
Implement comprehensive testing and validation:

Unit tests with Flutter’s testing suite.
Widget tests to validate UI behavior.
Integration tests to ensure robust offline functionality.
Evaluate offline support thoroughly:

Ensure accurate data persistence without internet.
Test edge cases (interrupted app states, restart scenarios, offline-to-online transitions, etc.).
Step 7: Optimization and Performance
Essential Tasks:
Ensure smooth and responsive UI/UX even when offline.
Optimize local database queries and caching mechanisms for quick data retrieval.
Monitor memory usage and optimize periodically.
Recommended Packages/Libraries:
hive / isar -> Local database solution.
provider / flutter_riverpod / bloc -> State management.
charts_flutter / syncfusion_flutter_charts -> Data visualizations.
Finalized Project Features and Objectives:
✔️ Full offline functionality
✔️ Comprehensive tracking of individual player dice rolls
✔️ Session-based analytics (roll count and session duration 'seven out')
✔️ Reliable and intuitive user interface
✔️ Robust state management and data persistence
✔️ Informative analytics (roll and session statistics)

This detailed, updated plan aligns closely with your goals, ensuring an optimized offline experience while clearly tracking the roll counts and sessions per player.
