## Icon Creation Process
1. Design the master 1024×1024 icon first
2. Scale down with appropriate adjustments for legibility at smaller sizes
3. Ensure the icon remains recognizable even at the smallest sizes
4. Test all icons on actual devices when possible

Once all icons are created, they can be added to the app using the Assets.xcassets folder in Xcode or through Flutter's platform-specific integration.
