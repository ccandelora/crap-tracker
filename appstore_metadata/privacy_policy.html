    <h1>Privacy Policy for The Rail</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: April 12, 2023</em></p>

    <p>Inogus Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") operates The Rail mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Rail is designed to function entirely locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from you when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All game data, including dice rolls, player information, and statistics, are stored locally on your device using encrypted storage. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports. This helps us improve the App's performance and user experience. The information collected includes:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>App performance data</li>
        <li>Feature usage statistics (anonymized)</li>
        <li>Crash logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personally identifiable information is collected through these services.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App uses Firebase for basic analytics. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for more information on how Firebase processes data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "last updated" date.</p>
